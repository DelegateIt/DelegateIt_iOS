# DelegateIt_iOS

1) Download the project and open "DelegateIt.xcworkspace".

2) Xcode should open and there should be 2 "Projects" (DelegateIt and Pods)

3) DelegateIt is the project you will most likely be working in and Pods are all the project dependencies

Note: If you get a linker error, you probably opened the wrong file ("DelegateIt.xcodeproj") which will open the Xcode project without the dependencies
